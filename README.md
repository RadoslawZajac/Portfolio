## About me

My journey with software testing began in 2022 and has continued ever since — it's a path I'm excited to keep exploring!

In my current role, I'm responsible not only for testing software but also for supervising a team of testers, preparing test reports, creating test cases, and actively participating in meetings such as Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospectives.

In my free time, I’m learning programming with GDScript, which I use to develop a game together with a group of friends. I also apply my software testing knowledge to test the game throughout its development.
